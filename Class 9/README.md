## Today's problem

Epitafio, a famous mathematician hired you for helping developing his brand new calculator system.

It is gonna be the newest state of art for most of the calculations done in his lab, therefore, he hired you, to implement very consistent and scalable calculations classes.

Epitafio is not so strict about the development, e everything he knows is that he would like the object orientation to be used on its best way.

The requirements are:
* All the calculations must implement the method double getResult() and void calculate(), which triggers the calculation.
* Unary calculations must always implement the method setNumber(double n).
* Binary calculations must always implement the method setNumbers(double n1, double n2).
* Array calculations must always implement the method setArray(double [] a);

The classes that he is expecting to instantiate for now are:
* Factor (which calculates the factoring of a given number)
* MinimalMultiple which takes two numbers and returns the smaller number that is multiple of the two
* AverageArray which takes an array and returns the normal average

In case of wrong number, the exception should be handled by the main (no need to treat errors in the class, let's see it in class )

Abstract classes, interface and these things should be implemented here eh.... ;)

The main is already pre-implemented but feel free to change it to better check your implementations.

**TIP**: As said by Jack, it is always better to divide things... Some stuff like interfaces and abstract classes are a bit too "abstract" to know if they are right soon, but the rest, try always to solve point by point and test things slowly ;).

Go go go =D
