## We will cover today

* We go through the main mistakes of the assignments
* Play with Inheritance and specially the subclasses
* Re-build class 4 examples using inheritance

## What we can do when we create subclasses (From the Oracle Tutorial bellow)
* The inherited fields can be used directly, just like any other fields.
* You can declare a field in the subclass with the same name as the one in the superclass, thus hiding it (not recommended).
* You can declare new fields in the subclass that are not in the superclass.
* The inherited methods can be used directly as they are.
* You can write a new instance method in the subclass that has the same signature as the one in the superclass, thus overriding it.
* You can write a new static method in the subclass that has the same signature as the one in the superclass, thus hiding it.
* You can declare new methods in the subclass that are not in the superclass.
* You can write a subclass constructor that invokes the constructor of the superclass, either implicitly or by using the keyword super.
