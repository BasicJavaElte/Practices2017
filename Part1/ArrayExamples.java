	Stuart is the owner of Gambling Loteries Inc, and he is facing a very serious problem
	the lady who usually takes out the balls with the numbers resigned and he has no one to replace her

	LÃ¡szlo, a good friend of him, provided a Virtual Reality robot able to do it for him,
	the only thing that Stuart needs to do is to provide the numbers on a screen separated by line.

	So everything Stuart needs now to save Gamblung Inc from bankruptcy is to find someone who can
	build an algorithm able to sort the 30 numbers from 0 to 50 and print them on the default screen.


	Can you help Stuart?
