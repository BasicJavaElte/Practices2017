## We will cover today

* Let's finish the previous exercise
* Primitive Arrays
* Classes and Objects keep going
* Interacting with the user (over and over)

## Today's problem
Let's create a software for calculating basic squared matrices operations


### Classes
* Matrix

### Matrix functions
    new MyMatrix(int squaredSize);

    addToMatrix(int line, int column, int value);

    sumMatrix(MyMatrix otherMatrix);

    multiplyMatrix(MyMatrix otherMatrix);

## Recommendations
Create a constant number on the Main that represents the amount of elements, this way, we can play with it differently
